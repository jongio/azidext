# Azure Identity Extensions

This repo is a place for us to share ideas and extensions to the Azure Identity libraries.

> WARNING: Nothing in this repo or related package managers is intended for production use.  The included code and packages are just stopgaps until they are implemented in the [official Azure SDKs](https://aka.ms/sdkdocs).

> ADDITIONAL WARNING: This hasn't been fully tested, so use at your own risk.  You are likely better off copying the code into your own project versus using via package managers.

## DefaultAzureMgmtCredential

The `DefaultAzureMgmtCredential` class allows you to use all the goodness of `Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential` in the Azure Management libraries. You can use it in place of `ServiceClientCredential` when calling your Azure Management APIs. The Azure Management libraries will be updated to support Azure Identity and Azure Core in early 2020, so this should just be used a a stopgap between now and then.

### .NET
```
dotnet add package JonGallant.Azure.Identity.Extensions
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Management.ApplicationInsights --version 0.2.0-preview
```

Use DefaultAzureMgmtCredential in place of ServiceClientCredential:
```csharp
using JonGallant.Azure.Identity.Extensions;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.ApplicationInsights.Management;

var appInsightsClient = new ApplicationInsightsManagementClient(new DefaultAzureMgmtCredential());
```

## DefaultAzureFluentCredential

The `DefaultAzureFluentCredential` class allows you to use all the goodness of `Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential` in the [Azure Management **Fluent** libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-libraries-for-net). You can use it in place of `AzureCredentials` when calling your Azure Management Fluent APIs. 

### .NET

```
dotnet add package JonGallant.Azure.Identity.Extensions
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Management.Fluent --version 1.30.0
```

Use `DefaultAzureFluentCredential` in place of `AzureCredentials`:

```csharp
using JonGallant.Azure.Identity.Extensions;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager.Fluent;

var creds = new DefaultAzureFluentCredential(tenantId, AzureEnvironment.AzureGlobalCloud);
                       
var resourceGroup = Azure.Authenticate(creds)
                        .WithSubscription(subId)
                        .ResourceGroups
                        .Define(name)
                        .WithRegion(region)
                        .Create();
```

## DefaultAzureServiceBusCredential

The `DefaultAzureServiceBusCredential` class allows you to use all of the goodness of `Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential` with the Service Bus SDKs.  Service Bus will officially be supported by the new SDKs soon, this is a stopgap that enables you to use the same credential flow throughout your application.

### .NET
```
dotnet add package JonGallant.Azure.Identity.Extensions
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus --version 4.1.1
```

```csharp
using JonGallant.Azure.Identity.Extensions;
using Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus;

var client = new TopicClient("sbendpoint", "entitypath", new DefaultAzureServiceBusCredential());
```

### Java

To use this type, just copy `DefaultAzureServiceBusCredential.java`  file located in `java/src/main/java/com/jongallant/azure/identity/extensions`directory into your application and make necessary package name updates.

Sample code to create a new topic client:

```java
ClientSettings clientSettings = new ClientSettings(new DefaultAzureServiceBusCredential());
TopicClient topicClient = new TopicClient("servicebus-endpoint", "servicebus-entitypath", clientSettings);
```



## DefaultAzureCredentialAdapter

### Java

The `DefaultAzureCredentialAdapter` class provides a simple bridge to use `DefaultAzureCredential` from `com.azure` namespace in `com.microsoft.azure` SDKs. This is a convenient mechanism to authenticate all fluent Azure Management Resources and a some data plane SDKs that use `ServiceClientCredential` family of credentials. 

To use this type, just copy `DefaultAzureCredentialAdapter.java` file located in `java/src/main/java/com/jongallant/azure/identity/extensions`directory into your application and make necessary package name updates.

After you have created this type, you can reference it in your code as shown below:

```java
Azure azure = Azure.authenticate(new DefaultAzureCredentialAdapter(tenantId)).withDefaultSubscription();
```

Above code will provide an instance of `Azure` fluent type from which you can access all Azure Resource Managers. 

#### Testing DefaultAzureCredentialAdapter

This repository has a test class called `DefaultAzureCredentailAdapterTest` that tests creation of a storage account, listing all storage accounts in a resource group to validate successful creation, then deleting the account created earlier in this test and listing again to ensure successful deletion.

To run `DefaultAzureCredentailAdapterTest`, ensure you have `.env` file created and accessible from your classpath. Your `.env` file should have the following properties set:

- AZURE_TENANT_ID
- AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME
- AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP

Once you have the `.env` file configured, run the test using JUnit 5 runner.
